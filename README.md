Facial Recognition in person
--------------
The main goal of this project is to translate human emotions into a digital format. There are two different ways we are currently thinking about doing this.

* Using the camera on an iPhone for real-time haptic feedback to inform users what the other person is feeling
* Using the camera to camera to translate a persons emotions into a data point via emoji

This is predomenantly for exploratory purposes, to see what is possible, but we do have other potential future projects that could be related.
